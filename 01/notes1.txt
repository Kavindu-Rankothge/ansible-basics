1. 
I have a ansible.cfg with inventory groups and hosts.
Can use: ansible <group_name> --list-hosts to see hots in the group
Can also define inventory and remote user in ansible.cfg file

2.
use -m for built in commands. 
ping checks if python is intalled
ansible -m ping <group_name>

[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = kavindu
ask_pass = false

3. 
can use these flags with ansible commands
ansible -i ./inventory -b (become) -u (user) --become-method = sudo, su
--become-user root
--ask-become-pass
